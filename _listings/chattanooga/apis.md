description: The Open Chattanooga Brigade empowers citizens with City data to tell
  stories, solve problems, and better interact with their government. A local chapter
  of the Code for America Brigade since 2012, our Brigade is seeking creative thinkers,
  neighborhood advocates, data nerds, designers, developers, and entrepreneurs to
  help develop meaningful solutions to local issues. The Brigade is the citizen arm
  of Open Chattanooga and needs the passion and skills to make the Collaboratives
  efforts meaningful.
